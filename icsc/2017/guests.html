										Evans studies the collective system of thinking and knowing—from attention and

										interested in how social and
										technical institutions (Internet, markets, collaborations) shape innovation and
										discovery. He builds novel
										“observatories” via crowdsourcing, text/image extraction, and distributed
										sensors, and employs machine
										learning, generative modeling, and social/semantic networks to scale
										interpretive and field methods and to
										propose alternatives to current discovery regimes. His research is supported by
