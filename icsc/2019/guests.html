										My research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging
										from
										the distribution of
										attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to
										processes of agreement (and
										dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture—novelty,
										ambiguity,
										topology—of
										understanding. I am especially interested in innovation—how new ideas and
										practices
										emerge—and the role that
										social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations)
										play
										in collective cognition
										and discovery. Much of my work has focused on areas of modern science and
										technology, but I am also interested
										in other domains of knowledge—news, law, religion, gossip, hunches, machine and
										historical modes of thinking
										and knowing. I support the creation of novel observatories for human
										understanding
										and action through crowd
										sourcing, information extraction from text and images, and the use of
										distributed
										sensors (e.g., RFID tags,
										cell phones). I use machine learning, generative modeling, social and semantic
										network representations to
										explore knowledge processes, scale up interpretive and field-methods, and create
										alternatives to current
										discovery regimes. My research has been supported by the National Science
										Foundation, the National Institutes
										of Health, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and many philanthropic
										sources, and has been published
										in <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em>, <em>PNAS</em>, <em>American Journal of
											Sociology</em>,
										<em>American Sociological Review</em>, <em>Social Studies of Science</em>,
										<em>Research Policy</em>,
										<em>Critical Theory</em>, <em>Administrative Science Quarterly</em>, and other
										outlets. My work has been
										featured in the <em>Economist</em>, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, <em>Wired</em>,
										NPR,
										BBC, <em>El País</em>,
										CNN, <em>Le Monde</em>, and many other outlets. At Chicago, I am Director of
										Knowledge Lab, which has
										collaborative, granting and employment opportunities, as well as ongoing
										seminars. I
										also founded and now
										direct the Computational Social Science program at Chicago, and sponsor an
										associated Computational Social
										Science workshop. I teach courses in augmented intelligence, the history of
										modern
										science, science studies,
										computational content analysis, and Internet and Society. Before Chicago, I
										received
										my doctorate in sociology
										from Stanford University, served as a research associate in the Negotiation,
										Organizations, and Markets group
										at Harvard Business School, started a private high school focused on
										project-based
										arts education, and

										Paolo has spent the last few years studying trust interactions in the online
