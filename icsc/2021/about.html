							UNIVERSITY</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="section-body">
						<p>Since the establishment of the Tsinghua School (Xuetang) in 1911, courses in political
							science and economics were offered. In 1925, the school launched its four-year undergraduate
							program. The Departments of sociology, political science, economics and educational
							psychology were among the seventeen first founded departments in 1926. In 1928, the
							authorities officially changed the name to National Tsinghua University, and established
							fifteen departments in the School of Liberal Arts, the School of Science and the School of
							Law. The Department of Sociology was in the School of Liberal Arts; the Department of
							Psychology was in the School of Science; and the Departments of Political Science and
							Economics in the School of Law.</p>
						<p>The study of social science at Tsinghua University has a long tradition of promoting
							interaction between Chinese and Western cultures and encouraging interdisciplinary
							communications between the Arts and the Sciences. Advocating for the application modern
							science methodologies in exploring political, economic and social phenomena, we learned from
							studies in foreign countries and followed international academic standards, with an emphasis
							on understanding current realistic problems in China. Founded on the ultimate goal to
							support the independent academic development of the nation and the construction of a new
							China, the school has made significant achievements in nurturing students and research.</p>
						<p>Many world-class scholars and social activists taught or studied in Tsinghua’s social science
							departments, including Fei Xiaotong (Fei Hsiao-Tung), Chen Daisun, Zhang Xiruo, Pan
							Guangdan, Qian Duansheng (Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng), Xiao Gongquan, Wang Tieya, Wang Yanan, Chen
							Da, Zhu Junyi, Wu Qiyuan, Zhao Yuanren (Chao Yuen Ren), Dai Shiguang, Xiao Qu, Wu Jingchao,
							Li Jinghan, Chen Tiqiang, and Tang Yue. They were pioneers of all Tsinghua faculties and
							students in social sciences disciplines who contributed to modern political and economical
							revival and social construction of China.</p>
						<p>In 1952, a nationwide restructuring of institutes of higher education began, and Tsinghua
							University became a multidisciplinary polytechnic university specializing in training
							engineers. Social science departments in Tsinghua University were shut down and faculties
							and students in the field left for other universities or institutions. Since 1978, however,
							Tsinghua University has strengthened its teaching in the sciences, economic management,
							humanities and law fields. Resuscitating its studies and research in social science
							disciplines, the Department of Social Science was rebuilt in 1984 and School of Humanities
							and Social Sciences was rebuilt in 1993, which included the Department of Philosophy and
							Sociology, Department of Chinese Language and Literature, Department of History, the
							Institute of Ideology and Culture, the Institute of Science, Technology and Society, the
							Institute of Economics, the Institute of Education, and the Institute of Art Education. In
							1997, the Institute of international studies was set up. In 2000, the Department of
							Sociology and Department of Political Science were re-established. Finally, in 2008, the
							Department of Psychology was re-established.</p>
						<p>In 2012, the first year after the centenary anniversary of Tsinghua University, the School of
							Humanities and the School of Social Sciences were founded separately on the basis of the
							original School of Humanities and Social Sciences. The School of Social Sciences includes
							the Department of Political Science, Department of International Relations, Department of
							Sociology, Department of Psychology, Institute of Economics. The School aims to meet the
							academic frontiers of the world and the strategic demands of our nation, and tries its best
							to attain new achievements in social sciences at Tsinghua University.</p>

						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="section-body">
						<p>The Tsinghua Center for Social Network Research was founded on Jan. 1st 2013. As a Tsinghua
							University research center, its purpose is to develop a platform for cooperation among
							physicists, computer scientists, and social, behavioral and epidemiology researchers, so
							that they can explore a set of interdisciplinary methodological approaches for studying
							complex social networks in big data.</p>
						<p>Big data brings a lot of opportunities and challenges for interdisciplinary research: Various
							domains of knowledge have developed and accumulated a large body of hypotheses, models and
							empirical findings on the structure, dynamic processes, and consequences of social networks.
						</p>
						<p>In order to arrive at a consensus we first need to create a methodological framework that
							takes data mining as its starting point. The object of research is online big data, which
							has the untapped potential to yield findings about new social phenomena. The next step is
							interpreting these findings through various qualitative and survey studies, which will
							further help us reveal grounded truth to verify theoretical hypotheses. The final step is
							building a model that encompasses the co-evolution of human actions and network structure
							based on the operative theories. With a model built on this solid foundation, researchers
							trained with interdisciplinary methods have the required information to predict new facts
							from their results.</p>
						<p>Running in parallel to our research are real-world surveys that often generate new facts that
							conflict with our interpretation of the results of data mining. In this kind of scenario, we
							must return to our data and begin an iterative process of data mining, theory development
							and dynamic model building; until we can reconcile the two sets of results.</p>
						<p>The goal of TCSNR is to develop a series of programs for training students with different
							research backgrounds, and mesh their different areas of expertise into a methodologically
							and substantively integrated whole. From this interdisciplinary training method we can
							expect new results and considerable progress in social network research.</p>
